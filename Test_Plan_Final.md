## 7. Deliverables
- Final Markdown file  
- Collaboration observations  
- Commit to GitHub

## 8. Observations on Collaboration
- Real-time cursors visible with minimal delay.  
- Concurrent edits on same line caused auto-merge; last writer’s change kept.  
- Version history preserved every few seconds.  
- Both participants could use “History” → “Versions” to restore older text.
